# chbot

a full-featured Telegram chatbot in a single file can be quite lengthy and complex, but I can provide you with a simple example using Node.js and the node-telegram-bot-api library. Please note that this is a basic implementation to get you started. For more advanced functionality, you might need to organize the code into multiple files and use external modules.
To run this example, you'll need to have Node.js installed and create a Telegram bot using the BotFather on Telegram. The BotFather will give you a bot token that you'll use in the code below. Save the code in a file (e.g., telegram_bot.js) and run it using node telegram_bot.js.

This example sets up a basic Telegram bot that responds to the /start, /echo, and /help commands. When a user sends the /start command, it sends a welcome message. When a user sends the /echo <message> command, it echoes back the provided message. When a user sends any other text, the bot responds with a default message indicating that it doesn't understand.
Remember to replace 'YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN' with the actual bot token you received from the BotFather. You can expand this example to handle more commands and implement more sophisticated logic based on your specific use case.
